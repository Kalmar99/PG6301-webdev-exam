### PG6301 Exam
My exam for the course PG6301 Web development and Api Design on HÃ¸yskolen kristiania.
Its a pokemon gotcha game made with react and express. Server provides an RESTful api and serves the front-end.
The front-end is a single page application made with react. The game is simple. you get 3 lootboxes (pokeballs) when you create an account, aswell as 5000 coins.
You can then buy lootboxes and get different kinds of pokemon based of what lootbox you open. You can also mill (sell) the pokemons you have aquired and earn more money to buy more lootboxes. There is 3 different lootboxes (pokeballs) to choose from and 9 different pokemons you can collect.
